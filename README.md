# `ovsinit`

`ovsinit` is a utility for safely restarting Open vSwitch daemons (such as
`ovs-vswitchd`, `ovsdb-server`, `ovn-controller`, etc.) in Kubernetes
environments with minimal dataplane disruption.

## Problem

Traditional Kubernetes rollouts stop the old pod before starting the new one.
If the container image isnâ€™t already pulled or startup is slow, the dataplane
can be down for several seconds. This leads to:

- Dropped packets
- Connection failures
- Noticeable cutovers in network services

Even with `RollingUpdate`, Kubernetes typically terminates first, starts
second, which is not ideal for critical network daemons.

## Solution

`ovsinit` enables in-place, low-downtime daemon restarts by leveraging
`appctl` for graceful shutdowns and `syscall.Exec` to replace the process
without changing its PID. This minimizes disruption during upgrades or
restarts.  It is designed to work with rollout strategies in the example
below.

```yaml
updateStrategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 0
    maxSurge: 1
```

This ensures the new pod is fully up and ready to take over before the old
one exits.

### How It Works

When `ovsinit` is used as the container entrypoint, it:

1. Detects whether the target OVS daemon is already running.
2. If so, uses `appctl` `exit` to gracefully stop it.
3. Waits for the process to terminate.
4. Uses `syscall.Exec` to start the new daemon in place

This provides a smooth handoff between instances without killing the dataplane
prematurely.

### Why It Matters

By starting the new pod _before_ terminating the old one, and letting `ovsinit`
handle the switchover internally, you:

- Avoid multi-second dataplane outages
- Skip image-pull delays
- Keep `ovsdb-server`/`ovs-vswitchd` state tightly controlled
- Ensure traffic disruption is measured in hundreds of milliseconds, not seconds

In testing, `ovsinit` consistently reduced restart downtime to a level that is
typically invisible to end users.
